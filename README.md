# number-one-portfolio
A portfolio site made for class, and for me to test my current knowledge and understaning 

## Description
For this homework assignment we had a week to build our own portfolio website from scratch. It was supposed to be basic, but being the overachiever disguised as a slacker that I am, decided to go above and beyond because I'm really enjoying learning how to code and wanted to show off what I learned. With that being said even though in certain instances (based off personal speculation) I was able to get a functioning code. My code works, but I feel as if I didn't really pass the media query part due to a true lack of understanding. Also due to my own ego filled dreams caused me to have to deal with a harder code to work with for smaller screens. I went with a two max-width media inquires mainly because that was used in our past assignments. I feel like I could've done better by assuming the media query were for the screen options you see when you inspect the browser.
